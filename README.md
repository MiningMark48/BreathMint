This mod does one thing, it adds another way to get Dragon's Breath without requiring killing the end dragon.

By right clicking on a **redstone powered** (animated) Dragon Head with an empty glass bottle, the player will receive Dragon's Breath. 

This mod was originally made at the request of Soaryn for Forgecraft.
