This mod does one thing, it adds another way to get Dragon's Breath without having to fight the end dragon repeatedly.

By right clicking on a **redstone powered** (animated) Dragon Head with an empty glass bottle, the player will receive Dragon's Breath.

In v0.0.2, a dispenser containing glass bottles with a Dragon Head in front will dispense Dragon's Breath when powered.

This mod was originally made at the request of Soaryn for Forgecraft.
